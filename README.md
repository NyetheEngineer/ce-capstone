Prerequisites
•	An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and configure AWS services.
•	Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your local machine.

 
Frontend UI: Select a framework like React, Vue.js, or plain JavaScript to build the user interface. For the purposes of this project, we will use React to build the frontend user interface.
1.	Clone or create a new React application on your local machine.
2.	Install the required dependencies, including Axios, which will be used to make HTTP requests to the API Gateway.
User Registration Form: The React.JS library will be used to create a form to collect user data 
1.	Create a form component in the React application to collect user data. Include fields for full name, age, occupation, nationality, marital status, and email address.
2.	User Authentication: The web app will be integrated with Amazon Cognito for secure user registration and login.
Setting up the Backend Development (AWS Services)
1.	DynamoDB: Create an AWS DynamoDB table to store the user data. Take note of the table name and its attributes.
2.	API Gateway: Create an API endpoint for handling user registration requests. Ensure that you enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow cross-origin requests.
3.	Lambda Functions: Develop a Lambda function triggered by API Gateway to:
o	Validate User Data: Ensure data integrity.
o	Store User Data: Save user data using the AWS SDK in your Lambda function for DynamoDB interaction.
o	Send Email Notification: Send a welcome email using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) upon successful registration.
4.	Amazon CloudWatch: Integrate CloudWatch to log user activity, API calls, and errors for monitoring and troubleshooting.
5.	Amazon SNS (optional): Consider setting up a topic in Amazon SNS to publish real-time user login events. The frontend can then subscribe to this topic to receive updates and display them on the dashboard.
Dashboard Feature
The dashboard feature offers real-time visualization of application usage metrics, including:
•	Active user count
•	Total user count
•	User login timestamps
•	Nationality distribution
DynamoDB Table Setup:
•	Create a DynamoDB table to store user data, including attributes for logged-in status, timestamps, and nationality.
Lambda Function Development:
•	Develop a Lambda function to query the DynamoDB table for real-time data. Process the retrieved data for display on the dashboard.

API Gateway Integration:
•	Set up an API Gateway endpoint to serve as the interface for the dashboard data.
•	Configure routes and security measures to ensure secure communication between the frontend and Lambda function.
Frontend Implementation:
•	Utilize a frontend framework  (React) to create the dashboard component.
•	Fetch real-time data from the API Gateway endpoint and render it on the dashboard.
User Authentication:
•	Employ AWS Cognito for user authentication and registration.
•	Retrieve the number of registered users from Cognito using its SDK or API.
Dashboard Integration:
•	Incorporate the retrieved user count into the dashboard component to display the total number of registered users.
Lambda Trigger:
•	Configure the Lambda function to be triggered by DynamoDB table updates, ensuring real-time data reflection on the dashboard.
AWS Services used:
•	API Gateway.
•	Lambda
•	DynamoDB
•	Cognito
•	SES
•	Event Bridge
•	S3 bucket
